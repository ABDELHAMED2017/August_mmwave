This is the simulation codes for paper Hybrid Beamforming for Millimeter Wave Systems Using the MMSE Criterion. Due to time limitation, 
the more formal version open source before, only includes codes for narrowband scenario. This repo is a little messy, nevertheless, can 
esily work by running **main_SNR.m** file. As all channel realizations can generate by these codes, no existed .mat files are needed. Although
I can't ensure that all figures shown in my paper have their corresponding main.m file, I believe they can all generated by easily 
changing the parameters in main_SNR.m file. 
> Due to time limitation, some codes are messy but I think it's still easy to understand. Meanwhile, I will improve it soon.

Hopefully it can be helpful to your work, and I'll be grateful if you star the repo or cite this paper.
Any problem please contact me by ```lint17@fudan.edu.cn``` or open an issues, I will response you as soon as possible.
